A simple CS50 Week 0 Scratch project demonstrating basic programming concepts such as events, loops, conditionals, and variables. Click the green flag to start and interact with the sprites using keyboard or mouse inputs.

🎮 CS50 Week 0 — Scratch Project

This repository contains my project for CS50x Week 0, created using Scratch, a beginner-friendly visual programming environment.

📌 Project Overview

This project was built by following the CS50 Week 0 walkthrough video. It demonstrates the fundamentals of programming using Scratch’s drag-and-drop blocks.
You can run the project by clicking the green flag and interacting with the sprites using your keyboard or mouse.

🧠 What This Project Teaches

This assignment reinforces the following core programming concepts:

Events – Start actions when the green flag is clicked or a key is pressed

Loops – Repeat movements or animations

Conditionals – Make decisions (e.g., “if touching edge then bounce”)

Variables – Store data such as score or position

Control Flow – Organize actions to run in a logical sequence

These concepts form the foundation for learning real code in future CS50 weeks.

🎮 How to Play / Interact

Open the project in Scratch (.sb3 file or via Scratch online).

Click the green flag to start the program.

Interact using:

Keyboard keys (e.g., arrows, spacebar)

Mouse clicks on sprites

Watch animations, movements, score changes, sounds, or any game logic included.
